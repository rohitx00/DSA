# dict utilities

This folder contains small Python scripts demonstrating common dictionary and collection operations.

Files

- [count_frequency.py](count_frequency.py): Counts frequency of items (e.g., elements in a list or characters in a string) and prints results.
- [merge_dict.py](merge_dict.py): Demonstrates merging dictionaries (combining keys/values from multiple dicts).
- [sum_same_key_value_merge.py](sum_same_key_value_merge.py): Merges dictionaries and sums values for keys that appear in multiple dicts.
- [sum.py](sum.py): Simple script that computes the sum of a list of numbers or inputs.

How to run

Run any script with Python from the repository root or this folder. Example:

```bash
python PYTHON_BASIC/ds/dict/count_frequency.py
```

Notes

- Each script is standalone and intended for learning/basic use. Adjust input data inside the scripts or modify them to accept command-line arguments for more flexible usage.
