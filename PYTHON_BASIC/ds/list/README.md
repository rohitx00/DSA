# List Operations in Python

This folder contains Python scripts demonstrating various operations on lists, including sorting, finding elements, calculating statistics, and using list methods.

## Files

### check_sort.py

- **Description**: Checks if a given list is sorted in ascending order by iterating through the list and comparing adjacent elements. Prints "List is not sorted" if any pair is out of order, otherwise prints "Your list is sorted".
- **Example List**: [23, -19, 98, 77, 11]

### greatest_element.py

- **Description**: Finds the greatest element in a list and its index by iterating through the list and updating the maximum value and its position.
- **Example List**: [23, -19, 98, 77, 11]

### list.py

- **Description**: Demonstrates various Python list methods such as append, count, extend, index, insert, reverse, pop, remove, copy, sort, and clear, with print statements showing their effects on a sample list.
- **Example List**: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

### mean.py

- **Description**: Calculates the mean (average) of a list by summing all elements and dividing by the length of the list.
- **Example List**: [33, 74, -24, 100, 67]

### positive_negative.py

- **Description**: Separates a list into positive and negative numbers, storing them in separate lists and printing each group.
- **Example List**: [2, 9, -1, -8, 10, 3, -15]

### second_greatest.py

- **Description**: Finds the second largest element in a list by tracking the largest and second largest values during iteration.
- **Example List**: [23, -19, 98, 77, 11]

### sort.py

- **Description**: Implements bubble sort to sort a list in ascending order by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Example List**: [23, -19, 98, 77, 11]
